# ML-Projects-2018
Short Machine Learning projects I made while exploring Computer Science and it's numerous avenues. 

1. Football - Given a dataset of football players and their attributes, find the most appropriate substitute for ‘Alexandre Song’.

2. Boston - Given a dataset of houses in Boston and their features, predict their prices.
