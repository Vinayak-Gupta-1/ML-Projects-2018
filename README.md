# ML-Projects-2018
Short Machine Learning projects I made while exploring Computer Science and it's numerous avenues. 

1. Football - Given a dataset of football players and their attributes, found the most appropriate substitute for ‘Alexandre Song’.

2. Boston - Given a dataset of houses and their features in Boston, predicted their prices.
